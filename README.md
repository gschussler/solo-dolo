# word-roulette
Lobby-based word game with real-time connectivity. Inspired by Scattergories and similar online loby-based games such as GarticPhone and Skribbl.io

Built upon the PERN stack and socket.io

### Work-In-Progress

- Chatroom is fully functional, but messages are sent twice. Small error in frontend coding, not fixed yet.

- Game functionality was postponed in order to properly incorporate Websockets through socket.io
