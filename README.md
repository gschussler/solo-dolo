# word-roulette
Lobby-based word game with real-time connectivity. Inspired by Scattergories and similar online lobby-based games such as [Gartic Phone]([url](https://garticphone.com/)) and [skribbl.io]([url](https://skribbl.io/))

### Work-In-Progress

- Chatroom is fully functional, but messages are sent twice. Small error in frontend coding, not fixed yet.

- Game functionality was postponed in order to properly incorporate Websockets through socket.io
